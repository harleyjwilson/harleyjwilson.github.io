**Hello!**

I'm Harley Wilson, a programmer and a learner.

I am undergoing a career transition to a software developer to be able to work deeply on complex problems. I am studying for a Bachelor of Computing (Software Engineering) at Curtin University. Previously, I was a Police Officer in the Western Australia Police Force. 

This site features the projects I am working on and my posts on what I am currently learning and incorporating into my life.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harleyjwilson/) or [send me an email](mailto:hi@harleyjwilson.com?subject=Hello). Check out my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/harleyjwilson). When you email me, I'll reply, even if it takes a bit longer.
