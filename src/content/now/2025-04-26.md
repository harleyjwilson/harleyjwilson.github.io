This year has started well, with many new changes happening.

I am excited to continue as a Security Engineer (Technical Lead) with [SecDim](https://secdim.com/) after earning my Bachelor of Computing from Curtin University. I am eager to focus on what [SecDim](https://secdim.com/) has to offer and contribute to building the platform.

My wife and I recently welcomed our first child, a baby girl. Naturally, this has disrupted sleep, but we are happy to start this new chapter. I won't be posting her photo online, except for maybe with the [MaskerAid app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/maskeraid/id1590163828).

Besides that, I am trying to keep the habit of training BJJ. I am focusing more on no-gi jiu-jitsu, which is easier in the summer. I am looking into building my network in my new industry (although not my strong suit) and keeping up-to-date in working with AI [^1] while building my skills as a software engineer.

[^1]: Tools like [llm](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/#) and [Repomix](https://repomix.com/) have been fun to play around with.
